# Random Number Guessing Game for Python
### Designed by Koi

## Description
It's a number guessing game! Built in Python, you have to guess a number between 1 and 100. If you get it wrong, you get more chances to guess with a hint about whether your last guess was higher or lower than your previous guess.

## Installation and Usage
Note: This guide is for Windows operating systems
You will need to have python 3 installed on your local machine to run the program. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


After you have downloaded python and set it up, download the index.py file.
From there, go to where you downloaded the file to and right click the file to open more options.
Look for an option to "Copy as path" and select it.
Once you have copied the path, go to the search bar and search for "Terminal". Open it.
In your terminal, enter the command "py" in the terminal line. 
Once you type in py, paste in the file location you copied earlier wtih Ctrl+V. Press enter to run the program


Once the program is running, you will be able to play the guessing game! Enter your guess in the large box in the center.
After entering your guess, click the button named "GUESS" close to the bottom of the application.
You will see a hint on whether your number is higher or lower than the random number as well as how many guesses you have left.
Once you are finished playing, you can press the x in the upper right corner of the application and close it down.

To replay the game, simply type in the py command with the file path and press enter again, and a new window will display.

I used a PythonGeeks tutorial found here: [PythonGeeks Number Guessing Game](https://pythongeeks.org/python-number-guessing-game-project-with-source-code/)
I coded the whole project by hand, so I deserve a tiny bit of credit too :)
